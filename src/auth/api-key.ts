 * digests are 32 bytes, so the comparison always runs, takes the same time whatever was
 * presented, and says nothing about length. There is deliberately no early return before
 * the hash: not on a length mismatch, not on an empty `presented`.
 *
 * An empty `expected` matches nothing, not even an empty `presented`. That test runs after
 * the comparison and looks only at the configured key, so it leaks nothing about it. It is a
 * second guard behind `requireApiKey`'s own refusal of an unset key, because the digests of
 * two empty strings are equal and a caller that skipped that guard would otherwise be open.
 * The guard is on `expected` and not on `presented` on purpose: a leading
 * `if (!presented) return false` would be an early return on the presented value, which is
 * the one property this function must not lose.
